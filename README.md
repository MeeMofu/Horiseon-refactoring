## Changes made

1. Update header to have semantic elements \<header>, \<nav>; removed extra uneeded class for \<span>

2. Removed footer

3. Change the hero and the 4 boxes into \<section> and \<article> for better redability

4. Remove extra CSS class for content and benefits sections, added break up comments for easy navigation

5. Add extra CSS code to define the body so that the size doesn't change on different bowser windows; extra padding is added so that the benefit section doesn't go out of the page
